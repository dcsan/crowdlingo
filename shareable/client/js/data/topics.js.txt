But I haven't been for a long time, although I might go this year with some friends. These days I go cycling when I can. At the weekends I like to cook and invite friends around for dinner. I'm a big fan of cooking programs, and often try to copy the recipes, but they don't always turn out very well."

For example, on Saturday morning, I have to take my son to his basketball games, and my daughter to football practice. Then I have to ship them off to parties or friends' houses. Two or three times a month, my wife and I go for a meal with friends, and once a month, we go the cinema when my parents look after the kids. There's a great little cinema that shows independent or foreign films just near where we live.",

The idea was that the lessons would give us the chance to do something sporty with our children, and it's great. The teacher is really good and we all have a fantastic time. Plus, we're getting better at tennis. Best of all, after an hour of tennis, the kids go off to play, and we can have a drink and a chat. Now, that's my idea of playing sport. Apart from that, I also go out bowling once a month.",

While I'm out, my husband prepares lunch which is usually ready by the time I get back. Apart from that, I play online video games and read a lot. Also, I go for a drink after work every Friday with my work colleagues. There's a pub nearby and we usually stay there for a couple of hours, which is good fun.",
